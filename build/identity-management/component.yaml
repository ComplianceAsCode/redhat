## CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
##

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. Red Hat Identity
#       Management Admins) to handle configuration management the
#       lines below can be uncommented:

## Developers note on SA-4 (1):
##  This control requires that developers of system components, e.g.
##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of
##  functional properties. Implimentation details are offered in
##  SA-4(2).

##  The majority of FedRAMP and FISMA Moderate systems refine this control

##    - Provide design and implementation regarding security-relevant
##      external system interfaces and high-level design;
##    - Provide design and implementation information required by the
##      SDL process;
##    - Above should be provided with a level of detail sufficient for
##      secure deployment.
