        OpenShift components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While OpenShift can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, OpenShift does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        To configure an IdP, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-ldap-identity-provider.html#configuring-ldap-identity-provider

        OpenShift does not have the ability to automatically
        disable user accounts. Automatic disabling of these
        accounts must happen at the centralized account
        management level; for example, within LDAP, Red Hat
        IdM, or Active Directory.

        To meet FISMA requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the respinsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        Using Role Based Access Control (RBAC), OpenShift roles can be used
        to grant various levels of access both cluster-wide as well as at
        the project scope. Users and gruops can be associated with, or bound
        to, multiple roles at the same time.

        For service accounts that might also have privileged access, Security
        Context Constraints (SCC) should be used to limit privileged actions
        in service accounts.

        For the cluster, the kubeadmin user should be completely disabled.

        To modify security policies users must first authenticate with

        Once authenticated users must elevate privileges to root access

        This is an organizational/procedural control outside the scope of
        OpenShift configuration.

        The customer will be responsible for requiring users to use the
        lowest level of access required to perform any given function. In
        terms of OpenShift, this may require creation of multiple logon
        accounts per user. When users require access to privileged functions
        or capability, they will need to logout from the unprivileged account
        and login with an account that has received appropriate RBAC rights.

        Note: OpenShift does not have privilege escalation capabilities similar
        to sudo in Linux. Users will have to completely logout/login when
        requiring privilege escalation between accounts.

        Beginning with OpenShift 4.3, when OpenShift is deployed on Red Hat Enterprise
        Linux, and FIPS is enabled as a kernel setting, OpenShift will use OpenSSL
        libraries instead of the native Golang crypto. The system operator will need to
        verify that OpenShift is being deployed on a version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
        that has been FIPS validated.

        Prior to OpenShift 4.3, remote sessions were encrypted using Golang-provided
        cryptography. While not FIPS validated, this included the following
        cryptographic algorithms and ciphers to protect the confidentiality
        and integrity of remote access sessions:
                - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

        OpenShift utilizes the firewall technology embedded into Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux. This technology, named firewalld, allows a system
        administrator to configure host-based rules which take effect
        immediately. This gives an OpenShift operator the ability to immediately
        drop all remote connections.

        Additionally, OpenShift nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).

#       ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-8:
#       Implimentation of this control varies between customers. Some agencies
#       maintain an inventory that state "OpenShift 4.x," whereas others want
#       named RPMs installed on the OpenShift components. The vast majority
#       follow the "OpenShift 4.x" listings. For those that do not, and want
#       complete listings of underlying RPMs, the following section should be
#       uncommented and updated.
#
#       If Satellite is managing the OpenShift nodes, documenting how OpenShift
#       components integrate into Satellite for centralized inventory management
#       is perfectly acceptable.

## Developers note on SA-4 (1):
##  This control requires that developers of system components, e.g.
##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of

        The customer is responsible for implementing cryptographic

        When running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, full disk encryption

        in transport, OpenShift uses cryptographic algorithms and ciphers to
