        For the purpose of conducting a vulnerability scan of CoreOS, the CoreOS nodes
        should be scanned using the OpenShift Compliance Operator. OpenShift supports
        RBAC for users and groups, appropriate vulnerability scans can be performed against
        the OpenShift web application interface. For the OpenShift Compliance Operator, only OpenShift
        Cluster Administators are able to access and run the operator for compliance and vulnerability scans.
