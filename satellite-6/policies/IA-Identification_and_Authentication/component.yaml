        The organization will be responsible for developing, documenting, and
        disseminating Identification and Authentication policy and procedures.
        A successful control response will need to address the content of the
        policy (which must include purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
        management commitment, coordination, and compliance) and procedures
        (which must facilitate the implementation of the policies and
        associated controls).

      text: |-
        The organization will be responsible for reviewing and updating the
        Identification and Authentication policy every 3 years, and procedures
        annually. A successful control response will need to address the

        initiating the review process, updating the policy and procedures,
        and providing approval of the updates.
