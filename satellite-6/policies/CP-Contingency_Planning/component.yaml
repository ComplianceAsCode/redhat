        The organization will be responsible for developing, documenting, and
        disseminating Contingency Planning policy and procedures. A
        successful control response will need to address the content of the
        policy (which must include purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
        management commitment, coordination, and compliance) and procedures
        (which must facilitate the implementation of the policies and
        associated controls).

        The organization will be responsible for reviewing and updating the
        Contingency Planning policy every  years, and procedures annually.
        A successful response will need to address the review and update
        process, including the role(s) responsible for initiating the review
        process, updating the policy and procedures, and providing approval
        of the updates.

        The customer will be responsible for developing a contingency plan
        meeting the specified requirements. A successful control response will
        need to address the maintenance, recovery, and resumption of customer
        applications, as well as any reliance on infrastructure functionality
        to perform these tasks, as outlined in policy guidance from CP-1.

        The customer will be responsible for distributing the contingency plan
        to key contingency personnel. A successful control response will need
        to address identification of key personnel (by name, title, or role)
        and the means by which the customer ensures that all key personnel
        receive the contingency plan.

    - key: c

        The customer will be responsible for coordinating contingency planning
        activities with incident handling activities. A successful control
        response will need to address the division of responsibilities between
        contingency personnel and incident response personnel, as well as the
        means by which contingency planning activities are activated in the
        event of a security incident.

    - key: d

        The customer will be responsible for reviewing the contingency plan
        at the required frequency. A successful control response will need to
        outline how reviews are initiated, performed, and signed off on.

        The customer will be responsible for updating the contingency plan to
        address relevant changes as well as any problems found in the
        contingency plan. A successful control response will need to discuss
        how updates are proposed, implemented, and approved.

    - key: f

        The customer will be responsible for communicating changes to the
        contingency plan to key contingency personnel. A successful control

        customer ensures that all key personnel receive the updated
        contingency plan.

    - key: g

        The customer will be responsible for protecting the contingency plan
        from unauthorized disclosure or modification. A successful control
        response will need to address policy, procedural, and technical
        safeguards that are in place to protect the contingency plan.

        The customer will be responsible for coordinating development of the
        contingency plan with related plans (such as business continuity plans,
        disaster recovery plans, etc.). A successful control response will need
        to address the coordination of initial development, as well as how
        updates to the contingency plan affect related plans and vice versa.

        The customer will be responsible for reserving capacity for processing

        This control is often inherited through your platform provider,
        e.g. Microsoft Azure implements this control on behalf of both PaaS
        and IaaS customers. A successful control response will indicate if this
        control is inherited through your platform provider, and if not,
        details how mission functions will be resumed.

        The customer will be responsible for identifying critical
        functionality for which processing capacity must be reserved in an
        alternate region. A successful control response will need to discuss
        the process by wich this determination is made. Once processing
        capacity is reserved in an alternate region for this critical
        functionality, the remainder of the control may be inherited
        from your infrastruture provider.

        The customer is responsible for identifying an alternate processing
        site that is separated from the primary processing site to reduce
        susceptibility to the same threats. Per FedRAMP guidance, the service
        provider may determine what is considered a sufficient degree of
        separation between the primary and alternate processing sites, based
        on the types of threats that are of concern. This control is often
        inherited from organizational processes.
