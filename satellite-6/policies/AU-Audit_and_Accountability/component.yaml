        The organization will be responsible for developing, documenting, and
        disseminating Audit and Accountability policy and procedures. A
        successful control repsonse will need to address the content of the
        policy (which must include purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
        management commitment, coordination, and compliance) and procedures
        (which must facilitate the implementation of the policies and
        associated controls).

    - key: b
      text: |-
        The organization will be responsible for reviewing and updating the
        Audit and Accountability policy every 3 years, and procedures
        annually. A successful control response will need to address the
        review and update process, including the role(s) responsible
        for initiating the review process, updating the policy and
        procedures, and providing approval of the updates.

        The organization will be responsible for determining which events
        their software applications must be capable of auditing. A successful
        control response will need to address the FedRAMP-required auditable
        events listed above as well as any additional events the organization
        feels should auditable based on organization needs.

        The organization will be responsible for implementing this control. A
        successful control response will need to address coordination with all
        interested parties (such as an internal SOC or security team) and
        incorporation of their input into business requirements in order to
        determine the selection of auditable events.

    - key: c

        The organization will be responsible for implimenting this control. A
        successful control response will include a discussion of the decision
        process behind the selection of auditable events and a justification for
        the selected events being sufficient to support after-the-fact
        investigation.

    - key: d

        The customer will be responsible for selecting a subsec of the events
        listed in AU-2(a) to be audited by the system. For FedRAMP compliance,
        these events must be monitored continuously. A successful control
        response will include a discussion of the rationale for the events
        chosen.

        Note this control only identifies which events are relevant for this
        information sysem. Technical implimentation, at a information system
        component level, is documented in AU-12(a).

        Customers are responsible for reviewing and updating the audited
        events annually or whenever there is a change in the threat environment.
        A successful control response will outline how often events are
        reviewed.

        The organization is responsible for generating audit records that contain
        information that establishes what type of event occured, when the event
        occurred, where the event occured, the source of the event, the
        outcome of the event, and the identity of any individuals or subjects
        associated with the event. A successful control response will outline
        what metadata the organization requires audit records to contain.

        The organization is responsible ensuring that the information system
        audit records conain all of the information required to meet
        FedRAMP requirements. A successful control response will outline the
        systems audit generation, and the content that it includes.

        Note: This control defines what supplimentary data audit records must
        contain, such as full text recording of privileged commands. Metadata
        elements of audit logs are defined in AU-3. Component configuration is
        established through AU-12(c).

        Customers are responsible for allocating audit record storage capacity
        in accordance with the organizations requirements. A successful control
        response will explain the procedures in place to ensure that audit
        storage is allocated according to meet customer requirements.

        Customers are responsible for review and analysis of the information
        system audit records at least weekly for indications of inappropriate
        or unusual activity. A successful control response will outline how
        often audit records are reviewed, and types of activities they are
        reviewed for.

        Customers are responsible for ensuring that audit review findings are

        Customers are responsible for employing automated mechanisms to
        integrate audit, review, analysis, and reporting process to support
        organizational processes for investigation and response to suspicious
        activities. A successful control response will review the automated
        tools used for integrating review, analysis, and reporting, and how
        these tools are employed.

        Customers are responsible for analyzing and correlating audit records
        accross different repositories to gain organiational-wide situational
        awareness. A successful control response will discuss how the organization
        correlates and analyzes audit records from different sources. This can
        include processes and tools used to meet these goals.

        Customers are responsible for ensuring that the information system
        provides an audit reduction and report generation capability that
        supports on demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements
        and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. A successful
        control response will discuss how the information system provides
        audit reduction and report generation that supports these requirements.
        This can include a discussion of tools used to provide this capability,
        and how they are used.

        Customers are required to authorize access to management of audit
        functionality to only a subset of privileged users. A successful control
        response will discuss how access to audit functionality is restricted
        to only appropriate personnel. This can include a description of who
        this functionality is restricted to, and how this is controlled.

        Customers are required to retain audit records for at least ninety
        days to provide support for after the fact investigations of security
        incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information
        retention requirements. A successful control response will discuss how
        long audit records are retained.

        Audit log retention may be configured in the underlying Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux audit daemon. If using a central or 3rd party
        logging solution, this may likely need to be configured in that tool.
