        Employing automated mechanisms to support the management of information
        system accounts is an organizational control outside the scope of Red Hat
        Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes configuration.

        Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes relies on OpenShift
        components that support automated management through monitoring of
        accounts and system activity by logging of related information.

        While Openshift can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, Red Hat Advanced
        Cluster Management for Kubernetes nor OpenShift provides
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        To configure an IdP, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-ldap-identity-provider.html#configuring-ldap-identity-provider

        Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes

        accounts must happen at the centralized account
        management level; for example, within LDAP, Red Hat
