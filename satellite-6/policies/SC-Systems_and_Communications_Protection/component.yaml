        The organization will be responsible for developing, documenting, and
        disseminating System and Communications Protection policy and
        procedures. A successful control response will need to address the
        content of the policy (which must include purpose, scope, roles,
        responsibilities, management commitment, coordination, and
        compliance) and procedures (which must facilitate the implementation
        of the policies and associated controls).

        The organization will be responsible for reviewing and updating the System
        and Communications Protection policy every 3 years, and procedures
        annually. A successful control response will need to address the
        review and update process, including the role(s) responsible for
        initiating the review process, updating the policy and procedures,
        and providing approval of the updates.

        The customer is responsible for protecting against or limiting
        the effects of attacks on bandwidth, attacks on transactional
        capacity, attacks on storage capacity by employing geo-replication,
        IP address blocking, network-based DDos protections. A successful
        control response will discuss how the information system is protected
        from these attacks.

        The customer will be responsible for producing, controlling, and

        the customer application) using NIST FIPS-compliant key management
        technology and proesses. A successful control response will need to
        address the processes and tools used for key generation and discuss
        the reasons they are considered compliant.
