## Developers note on SA-4 (1):
##  This control requires that developers of system components, e.g.
##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of
##  functional properties. Implimentation details are offered in
##  SA-4(2).

##  The majority of FedRAMP and FISMA Moderate systems refine this control

##    - Provide design and implementation regarding security-relevant
##      external system interfaces and high-level design;
##    - Provide design and implementation information required by the

##    - Above should be provided with a level of detail sufficient for
