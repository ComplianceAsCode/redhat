        CoreOS was designed to satisfy the audit requirements outlined
        in the Configuration Annex to the Protection Profile for General
        Purpose Operating Systems available at
        https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/PP.cfm.

        Specifically, the minimum auditable events included:

        | Configuration Action | CNSSI 1253 Value or DoD-specific Value | NIAP Reference |
        | Audit All Logons (Success/Failure) and Logoffs (Successful) | Authentication events: (1) Logons (Success/Failure); (2) Logoffs (Success) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit File and Object Events (Unsuccessful) | File and Objects events: (1) Create (Success/Failure); (2) Access (Success/Failure); (3) Delete (Success/Failure); (4) Modify (Success/Failure); (5) Permission Modification (Success/Failure); (6) Ownership Modification (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit User and Group Management Events (Success/Failure) | User and Group Management events: (1) User add, delete, modify, disable, enable (Success/Failure); (2) Group/Role add, delete, modify (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit Privilege or Role Escalation Events (Success/Failure) | Privilege/Role escalation (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit All Audit and Log Data Accesses (Success/Failure) | Audit and log data access (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit Cryptographic Verification of Software (Success/Failure) | - | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit Program Initiations (Success/Failure) | Application (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, MS Office Suite, etc.) initialization (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit System Reboot, Restart, and Shutdown Events (Success/Failure) | System reboot, restart and shutdown (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit Kernel Module Loading and Unloading Events (Success/Failure) | - | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |

        Additionally, CoreOS was designed to satisfy the audit requirements
        outlined in Intelligence Community Standard Number 500-27, "Collection
        and Sharing of Audit Data" (ICS 500-27) that were found to be applicable
        to operating systems performing as a container host. A copy of ICS 500-27
        can be found at
        https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/FOIA/DF-2016-00213.pdf

        Selected audit events from ICS 500-27 include:
          * Authentication events
            * Logons (Success/Failure)
            * Logoffs (Success)
          * File & Object Events

            * User add, delete, modify, suspend, lock (Success/Failure)
            * Group/Role add, delete, modify (Success/Failure)

        Red Hat did not express judgement in the rationale for why auditable

        For rationale regarding why the auditable events are deemed to be

        Determination of which events are to be audited within CoreOS from
        the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2(a) is an organizational
        control outside the scope of CoreOS configuration guidance.

        Should system operators decide to use the NIST National Checklist for
        OpenShift 4.x, all events identified in AU-2(c) are selected to be
        audited.

        Additionally, in regards to the AU-2(d) requirement of defining
        "the frequency" of auditing for each identified event, it should be
        noted that the CoreOS audit subsystem generates audit events in
        realtime (e.g. immediately upon an audited event occuring).

        By default, CoreOS auditing uses the internal system clocks to generate
        time stamps for audit records. At the code level, this is accomplished
        through the use of the C programming language time.h which is part of the
        C Standard Library.

    - key: b
      text: |-
        By default, the CoreOS auditing records time stamps for audit records
        that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example
        in the following node audit record:

        type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1364481363.243:24287): arch=c000003e syscall=2 success=no exit=-13 a0=7fffd19c5592 a1=0 a2=7fffd19c4b50 a3=a items=1 ppid=2686 pid=3538 auid=1000 uid=1000 gid=1000 euid=1000 suid=1000 fsuid=1000 egid=1000 sgid=1000 fsgid=1000 tty=pts0 ses=1 comm="cat" exe="/bin/cat" subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 key="sshd_config"
        type=CWD msg=audit(1364481363.243:24287):  cwd="/home/shadowman"
        type=PATH msg=audit(1364481363.243:24287): item=0 name="/etc/ssh/sshd_config" inode=409248 dev=fd:00 mode=0100600 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 obj=system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0  nametype=NORMAL cap_fp=none cap_fi=none cap_fe=0 cap_fver=0

        The msg field records a time stamp and a unique ID of the record in the form audit(time_stamp:ID).
        Multiple records can share the same time stamp and ID if they were generated
        as part of the same Audit event. The time stamp is using the Unix time
        format - seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

        See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/auditing-the-system_security-hardening

        Per AU-4 (1), CoreOS will be configured to offload audit records
        to a centralized audit facility. Enforcement of dual authorization
        for movement and/or deletion of organization-defined audit
        information is the responsibility of the centralized audit
        facility, and outside the scope of CoreOS configuration.
