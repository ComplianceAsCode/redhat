        OpenShift components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While OpenShift can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, OpenShift does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        To configure an IdP, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html

        Note that the using the htpasswd IDP type cannot cover this
        control, therefore using httpasswd based IDPs should render
        the system non-compliant.

        To meet FISMA requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the responsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        OpenShift automatically audits creation of the Identity
        API objects which subsequently allow to match the creation
        of the OpenShift identity to the external IDP identity. See
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/audit-log-view.html

        To meet the requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication via an IDP. The account
        inactivity timeout can be either configured per OAuth client
        as described here:
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/configuring-oauth-clients.html#oauth-token-inactivity-timeout_configuring-oauth-clients

        Or globally (this example uses 600s timeout):
        $ oc patch oauth.config cluster -p '{"spec":{"tokenConfig":{"accessTokenInactivityTimeout": "600s"}}}' --type='merge'

        Note that the global configuration does not change the configuration
        of the oauthclient objects, so for proper compliance check, both must
        be audited.

        Also note that prior to OpenShift 4.8, changing the global oauth.config
        object triggers a rollout of the kube-apiserver which can take up
        to 15 minutes. You can watch the kube-apiserver rollout with
        "oc get co kube-apiserver". Once the rollout finishes, the "Progressing"

        Establishing and administering privileged user accounts in accordance with a
        role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and
        privileges into roles is an organizational control outside the scope of OpenShift

        However to facilitate a control response, using Role Based Access Control (RBAC),
        OpenShift roles can be used to grant various levels of access both cluster-wide as well as at
        the project scope. Users and groups can be associated with, or bound
        to, multiple roles at the same time.

        For service accounts that might also have privileged access, Security
        Context Constraints (SCC) should be used to limit privileged actions
        in service accounts.

        For the cluster, the kubeadmin user should be completely disabled.

        OpenShift uses the concept of users and groups to segregate subjects and objects.
        A user can be assigned to one or more groups, each of which represent a certain
        set of users. Groups are useful when managing authorization policies to grant
        permissions to multiple users at once, for example allowing access to objects
        within a project, versus granting them to users individually.

        OpenShift Security Context Constraints (SCC) control the actions that a pod can
        perform and what it has the ability to access.

        Changes to OpenShift information flows take effect immediately. It is assumed
        that all information flow modifications have undergone organizational
        approval processes prior to being implemented in OpenShift.

        OpenShift cannot protect against authenticated users who were
        given authorization to execute administrative commands (such as
        information flow modifications).

        Privileged Administrators are defined as authenticated users who
        were given authorization to execute privileged commands on OpenShift
        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        To modify security policies users must first authenticate with
        standard credentials (e.g. username/password or username/key).
        Once authenticated users must elevate privileges to root access
        through usage of "sudo", which will require users to re-authenticate
        themselves.

        The default system behavior allows Privileged Administrators
        to (re)configure security policy filters. For example,
        to reflect changes in network security policies, Privileged
        Administrators can dynamically change the allowed network
        ports and protocols that security policy mechanisms (such
        as firewalld) check in accordance with the definitions

        terms of OpenShift, this may require creation of multiple logon

        and login with an account that has received appropriate RBAC rights.

        Note: OpenShift does not have privilege escalation capabilities similar

        requiring privilege escalation between accounts.

        It is recommended to grant the cluster-admin clusterrole

        The customer will be responsible for defining events or conditions

        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/configuring-internal-oauth.html#oauth-configuring-internal-oauth_configuring-internal-oauth

        Note that the global configuration does not change the configuration
        of the oauthclient objects, so for proper compliance check, both must
        be audited.

        Also note that prior to OpenShift 4.8, changing the global oauth.config
        object triggers a rollout of the kube-apiserver which can take up
        to 15 minutes. You can watch the kube-apiserver rollout with
        "oc get co kube-apiserver". Once the rollout finishes, the "Progressing"
        column will say "False".

        The customer will be responsible for requiring remote access
        connections to the customer application to be routed through
        customer-defined network access control points. A successful control
        response will need to address the nature, number, and location of
        such access control points, as well as the security controls in place
        to protect those access control points.

        Managed access points can be created and configured through the use of
        bastion hosts, ingress rule(s), and/or opening a route to a new access point.

        Documentation for creating and using a bastion host can be viewed at:

        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/accessing-hosts.html

        Documentation for creating an ingress rule can be viewed at:

        This control is inherently met by Red Hat OpenShift.

        OpenShift nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.

        In order to disconnect all users, delete all OAuth tokens:
        $ oc delete oauthaccesstoken --all

        Since neither Kubernetes nor Red Hat OpenShift support CRLs or
        OSCP, the advice is not to use x509 certificates. If certificates
        must absolutely be used, use very short-lived certificates and
        as a last resort, instead of preventing authentication, remove all
        RBAC rules associated with accounts that possess x509 certificates.
