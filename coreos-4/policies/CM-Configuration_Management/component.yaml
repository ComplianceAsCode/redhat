# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).

        Configuration management is enforced through Ignition configurations
        and Operators.

        Ignition is the utility that is used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)
        to manipulate disks during initial configuration, confirming all new machines
        meet the declared configuration.

        Ignition is meant to initialize systems, not change existing systems. After
        a machine initializes and the kernel is running from the installed system, the
        Machine Config Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform cluster completes
        all future machine configuration.

        Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes
        application. Watching over the Kubernetes environment, using its current
        state to make decisions in real time. The Machine Config Operator (MCO)
        manages updates and configuration changes to essentially everything between
        the kernel and kubelet.
