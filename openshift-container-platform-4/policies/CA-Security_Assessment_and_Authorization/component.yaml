        Development of an organizational security assessment plan
        is outside the scope of OpenShift configuration guidance.

        As supplemental comments, the <i>NIST National Checklist for
        OpenShift</i> is recommended as the source of configuration guidance
        for US Government deployments. NIST National Checklists applicable
        to Red Hat technologies can be found on nist.gov:

        https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository?authority=Red+Hat&startIndex=0

        The NIST National Checklist for OpenShift provides SCAP-formatted
        automation content which could be used in satisfaction of
        CA-2(b), and is interoperable with any NIST SCAP Validated Product
        and Module.

        Additionally, SCAP scanners will generate a compliance report which
        could be used to satisfy CA-2(c).

        Creating an information system-level Plan of Action

        configuration processes.

        However, to aid in remediating or
        mitigating any known weaknesses or deficiencies in
        OpenShift, Red Hat is planning to make public a POA&M specific
        to OpenShift. This is currently in progress. If you would like to
        monitor or collaborate in the creation of the OpenShift POA&M,
