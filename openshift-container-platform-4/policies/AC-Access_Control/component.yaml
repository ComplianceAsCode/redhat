        OpenShift components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While OpenShift can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, OpenShift does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        To meet FISMA requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the respinsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        Using Role Based Access Control (RBAC), OpenShift roles can be used
        to grant various levels of access both cluster-wide as well as at
        the project scope. Users and gruops can be associated with, or bound
        to, multiple roles at the same time.

        For service accounts that might also have privileged access, Security
        Context Constraints (SCC) should be used to limit privileged actions
        in service accounts.

        For the cluster, the kubeadmin user should be completely disabled.

        'Beginning with OpenShift 4.3, when OpenShift is deployed on Red Hat Enterprise
        Linux, and FIPS is enabled as a kernel setting, OpenShift will use OpenSSL

        that has been FIPS validated.

        Prior to OpenShift 4.3, remote sessions were encrypted using Golang-provided
