        Privileged Administrators are defined as authenticated users who
        were given authorization to execute privileged commands on CoreOS
        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        To modify security policies users must first authenticate with
        standard credentials (e.g. username/password or username/key).
        Once authenticated users must elevate privileges to root access
        through usage of "sudo", which will require users to re-authenticate
        themselves.

        Privileged Administrators are defined as authenticated users who

        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        The default system behavior allows Privileged Administrators
        to (re)configure security policy filters. For example,
        to reflect changes in network security policies, Privileged
        Administrators can dynamically change the allowed network
        ports and protocols that security policy mechanisms (such
        as firewalld) check in accordance with the definitions
        provided by organizations.

        The customer will be responsible for requiring remote access

        customer-defined network access control points. A successful control

        CoreOS utilizes the firewall technology embedded into the
        distribution. This technology, named firewalld, allows a system
        administrator to configure host-based rules which take effect
        immediately. This gives an CoreOS operator the ability to immediately
        drop all remote connections.

        Additionally, CoreOS nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.
