# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implementation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).

        The recommended approach for configuration management in the OpenShift Container
        platform is to implement the principles and patterns of GitOps

        GitOps uses Git pull requests to manage infrastructure and application configurations.
        The Git repository is considered the only source of truth and contains the
        entire state of the system so that the trail of changes to the system state are
        visible and auditable.

        Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes
        application. Watching over the OpenShift environment, using its current
        state to make decisions in real time. The Machine Config Operator (MCO)
        manages updates and configuration changes to essentially everything between
        the kernel and kubelet.

        For additional information:
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/cicd_gitops.html
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/olm-what-operators-are.html

        Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) is the preferred way of implementing
        and managing GitOps for OpenShift clusters. For more information on creating and managing
        channels for GitOps approaches using RHACM, see:

#       Implementation of this control varies between customers. Some agencies

#       named RPMs installed on the OpenShift components. The vast majority
#       follow the "OpenShift 4.x" listings. For those that do not, and want
#       complete listings of underlying RPMs, the following section should be
#       uncommented and updated.
#
#       If Satellite is managing the OpenShift nodes, documenting how OpenShift
#       components integrate into Satellite for centralized inventory management
#       is perfectly acceptable.

        The organization is responsible for updating the inventory of information
        system components as an integral part of component installations, removals,
        and information system updates.

        During an install, update, or removal, the OpenShift cluster will roll out updates
        for the system software inventory including the CoreOS nodes. More about updating
        to help with creating procedures and processes related to this control can be viewed

        Ensuring that the organization uses software and associated

        is the complete responsibility of the organization. Red Hat's
        responsibilities to assist with the tracking of software licensing and

        with all applicable contracts and agreements established for the

        Tracking the use of software and associated documentation protected by
        quantity licenses to control copying and distribution is an
        organizational control outside the scope of OpenShift.

        However to assist Systems Administrators and Security personnel in
        tracking OpenShift subscriptions, the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM)
        service acts as a bridge to Red Hat Subscription Manager. A cluster
        connected to the internet can send telemetry to OpenShift Cluster
        Manager at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/, which then handles
        integration with Red Hat Subscription Manager to track subscriptions
        for OpenShift clusters.

        For disconnected clusters, there is no way to send telemetry data to
        OpenShift Cluster Manager. In this case, the organization must manually
        register their disconnected clusters with OpenShift Cluster Manager
        following the instructions at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4930131
