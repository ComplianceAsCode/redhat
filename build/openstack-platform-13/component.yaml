# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. Red Hat OpenStack Platform Admins) to
#       handle configuration management the lines below can be uncommented:

        'Red Hat OpenStack inherits many memory protections provided
        by the underlying operating system. When running on Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux, such kernel-level memory protections
        have undergone Common Criteria Certification.

        Certain hypervisors use memory optimization techniques that overcommit
        memory to guest virtual machines. This is a useful feature that allows
        deployment of very dense computer clusters. One approach to this
        technique is through deduplication or sharing of memory pages.

        When two virtual machines have identical data in memory, there are
        advantages to having them reference the same memory. Typically this
        is achieved through Copy-On-Write (COW) mechanisms, such as kernel
        same-page merging (KSM), These mechanisms are vulnerable to certain
        attacks.

        Memory deduplication systems are vulnerabile to side-channel attacks.
        In academic studies, attackers were able to identify software packages
        and versions running on neighboring virtual machines as well as
        software downloads and other sensitive information through analyzing
        memory access times on the attacker Virtual Machine. Consequently, one
        Virtual Machine can infer something about the state of another, which
        might not be appropriate for multi-tenant environments where not all
        tenants are trusted or share the same levels of trust.

        More importantly, row-hammer type attacks have been demonstrated
        against KSM to enact cross-Virtual Machine modification of
        executable memory. A hostile instance could gain code execution
        access to other instances on the same Compute host.

        Deployers should disable KSM if strong project separation (as
        with public clouds and some private clouds) is required.

        To disable KSM, refer to:
