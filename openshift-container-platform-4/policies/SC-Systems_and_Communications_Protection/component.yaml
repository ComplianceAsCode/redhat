        The customer is responsible for deployment utilizing namespaces,
        host roles and other features as well as policies and procedures
        to implement and ensure continued isolation of security functions
        from non-security functions.

        A common way of ensuring that workloads land on certain nodes is
        through the usage of taints and tolerations [1]. This ensure that
        unless a workload tolerates the specified taints on the node, it won't
        be scheduled there.

        Another alternative is the usage of node affinity which allows a
        workload to specify a set of restrictions for it to be scheduled [2].

        These mechanisms can be used to ensure that only allowed hardware
        is used to run the desired workloads.

        OpenShift namespaces/projects are used to isolate resources
        in the cluster. If a Secret or a ConfigMap object exists
        in the cluster, it will only be accessible by other resources
        on that same namespace. Only users with explicit access to a
        namespace are able to access those objects.

        Accidental exposure of secrets is prevented by the Kubelet itself,
        since it's responsible of deleting the secret once no
        workload is using it [1]

        Depending on the exposure of the workloads or the component that's
        intended to be protected, OpenShift offers several settings to enforce
        rate-limiting and protection against denial of service attacks.

        It is recommended that all workloads in the system establish appropriate
        resource requests and limits to avoid resource starvation of critical
        workloads. Appropriate configurations exist to manage resource
        overcommitment [1]. Ensure that appropriate quotas are set in each
        relevant project [2], or establish a cluster quota to limit the resources
        that workloads can take [3].

        OpenShift also allows the configuration of egress and ingress traffic
        for individual workloads [4]. This ensures that workloads don't get
        overwhelmed by incoming traffic, and that they don't act as Denial
        of Service agents.

        If a workload is to be exposed externally, it is recommended that it's
        behind an OpenShift Route. Routes allow for the configuration of several
        security attributes, but most relevant to this control is the rate-limiting
        settings that it allows to configure in the form of annotations. configuring
        rate-limiting settings for a workload exposed on a route not only protects
        the workload itself, but also ensures that the target workload doesn't
        interfere with other workloads placed on the same node or set of nodes.

        On the other hand, OpenShift's API is configured with the Kubernetes API
        Priority & Fairness feature enabled by default. This feature allows for
        fine-grained configuration of the handling of incoming requests. [6]
        This way it's possible to control how the cluster will react on an
        overload situation. By default, OpenShift has a catch-all configuration
        that classifies every request.

        Finally, regardless of the environment that OpenShift is deployed in,
        it is assumed that there is a load balancer or load balancing service
        handling requests for the OpenShift API. This provides redundancy and
        extra protection when dealing with Denial of Service attacks.

        The customer will be responsible for ensuring that OpenShift is
        isolated from other internal information system components by
        implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed
        interfaces to other components of the system.

        OpenShift inherently meets this control as it comes with the Multus plugin [1]
        which allows administrators to chain multiple CNI plugins.
        These plugins can be attached to physically separate networks.

        While OpenShift auto-generates several PKIs to serve TLS on different
        endpoints of the system, it is possible and necessary to configure a
        custom PKI which allows external clients trust the endpoints.

        The Ingress Operator is the component responsible for enabling external
        access to OpenShift Container Platform cluster services. The aforementioned
        operator creates an internal CA and issues a wildcard certificate that is
        valid for applications under the .apps sub-domain. Both the web console
        and CLI use this certificate as well. The certificate and key would need
        to be replaced since a certificate coming from an approved provider is
        needed. [1]

        While the API Server certificates can't be replaced, it's possible to
        add extra certificates that it will serve in case there's the need
        for clients to have explicit trust for them. [2]

        OpenShift's internal DNS implementation inherently meets this
        control as the CoreDNS instances deployed by the cluster-dns-operator
        are run as a DaemonSet, and hence, run on every node on the cluster. [1]

        This implementation provides adequate fault tolerance since there
        are as many replicas as there are nodes in the cluster. Moreover,
        by default nodes in the cluster are deployed in different availability
        zones on the hosting cloud. This same pattern is recommended for
        on-prem deployments.

        Logging in "initiates a session" by having the user
        authenticate and receive a token if the authentication
        succeeds [1].  When logging out, both via the CLI and
        the UI, the user's "session" is ended by having the
        token deleted and effectively revoked.

        The user will be forced to re-authenticate before
        starting a new session.

        The customer is responsible for implementing cryptographic

        When running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, full disk encryption
        is possible for data at rest on the OpenShift nodes. For data
        in transport, OpenShift uses cryptographic algorithms and ciphers to
        protect confidentiality and integrity of data in transport.
