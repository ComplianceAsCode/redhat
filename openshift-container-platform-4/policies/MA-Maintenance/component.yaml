        Red Hat OpenShift does not have special maintenance or diagnostics
        accounts or login procedures except for backup and restore
        of the etcd database which requires ssh access:
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.html
        For ssh access, the only permitted authenticator are ssh keys provided
        via MachineConfig objects.

        Similarly to what is being suggested in the AC control family,
        it is recommended to grant the cluster-admin clusterrole
        to a user or a group backed by an IDP and subsequently
        remove the kubeadmin user as described in https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/remove-kubeadmin.html

        With that, any login session can be terminated by removing the
        appropriate "oauthaccesstoken" API object.

        When restoring the etcd database, the RHCOS hosts need to be configured
        to terminate idle sessions.
