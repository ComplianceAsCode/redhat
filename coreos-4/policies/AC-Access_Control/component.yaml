        CoreOS components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While CoreOS can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, CoreOS does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software, and therefore, this control is partial,
        and will only be partially satisfied when implemented by
        third party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        The ability to use Ignition scripts to configure CoreOS
        to add local users means that this control needs to be
        addressed for the case that a local user was added.

        See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CMP-199 for local
        user account handling in CoreOS.

        Establishing and administering privileged user accounts in accordance with a
        role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and
        privileges into roles is an organizational control outside the scope of OpenShift

        However to facilitate a control response, using Role Based Access Control (RBAC),
        OpenShift roles can be used to grant various levels of access both cluster-wide as well as at
        the project scope. Users and groups can be associated with, or bound
        to, multiple roles at the same time.

        For service accounts that might also have privileged access, Security
        Context Constraints (SCC) should be used to limit privileged actions
        in service accounts.

        For the cluster, the kubeadmin user should be completely disabled.

        More information on RBAC can be viewed at:

        CoreOS utilizes the firewall technology embedded into the
        distribution. This technology, named firewalld, allows a system
        administrator to configure host-based rules which take effect
        immediately. This gives an CoreOS operator the ability to immediately
        drop all remote connections.

        Additionally, CoreOS nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.
