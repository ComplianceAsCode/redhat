        OpenShift components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While OpenShift can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, OpenShift does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software, and therefore, this control is partial,
        and will only be partially satisfied when implemented by
        third party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

# AC-2(2) NOTES:
#       The customer will be responsible for automatically removing or
#       disabling emergency and temporary accounts within the required
#       timeframe. A successful control response will need to address
#       all of the procedures and mechanisms involved in disabling these
#       accounts.

        identity service (e.g. Active Directory, LDAP, etc.)
        This control will only be partially satisfied when
        OpenShift is configured to connect to an Identity Provider (IdP).

        OpenShift end-user account management is inherited from

        To meet FISMA requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the respinsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        Using Role Based Access Control (RBAC), OpenShift roles can be used
        to grant various levels of access both cluster-wide as well as at
        the project scope. Users and gruops can be associated with, or bound
        to, multiple roles at the same time.

        For service accounts that might also have privileged access, Security
        Context Constraints (SCC) should be used to limit privileged actions
        in service accounts.

        For the cluster, the kubeadmin user should be completely disabled.

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. OpenShift Admins) to
#       handle configuration management the lines below can be uncommented:

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2(2):

#
#       If CM-6(1) is selected, which is mandatory for FISMA Moderate and
#       FedRAMP systems, the organization must centrally employ automated
#       mechanisms for configuration management (e.g. Ansible Tower).

## Developers note on SA-4 (1):
##  This control requires that developers of system components, e.g.
##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of
##  functional properties. Implimentation details are offered in

##    - Provide design and implementation regarding security-relevant
##      external system interfaces and high-level design;
##    - Provide design and implementation information required by the
