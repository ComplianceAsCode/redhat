        In OpenShift, the logs depend greatly on the component. Some
        components would just write messages to stdout that the cluster
        administrator can retrieve logs through the use of the `oc` command.
        Some components emit events, and others emit a Prometheus metric which
        the API server would write into their logs.

        For the OCP components that run in a container (most operators),
        the usual RBAC rules would prevent a non-admin user from reading
        the container logs or events.

        For CoreOS, standard unix permissions protect access to logs.
        CoreOS error message handling is designed to obscure or not log
        sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, social
        security information, account information, etc.
