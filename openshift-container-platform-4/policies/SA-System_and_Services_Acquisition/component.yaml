## Developers note on SA-4 (1):

##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absence of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of
##  functional properties. Implementation details are offered in
