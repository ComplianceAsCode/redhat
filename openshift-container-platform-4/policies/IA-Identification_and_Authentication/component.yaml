        OpenShift has no concept of local accounts and was designed without the use of local accounts.
        OpenShift relies on a centralized identity provider rather than a local identity provider.
        The closest implementation concept of a local user account store would be the implementation
        of the htpasswd identity provider. However, use of this provider is not recommended for
        any reason for any security conscious environments or organizations.

        Because OpenShift has no concept of local accounts, the implementation of

        Ensuring  that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded
        in applications or access scripts or stored on function keys, is
        an organizational procedural requirement outside the scope of
        OpenShift configuration.

        Some general guidance can be provided for Kubernetes Secrets and
        private PKI keys stored on the filesystem.

        The private PKI keys are only protected by a combination of UNIX
        permissions and SELinux labels, but otherwise they are stored
        unencrypted on the filesystem.

        Regarding Kubernetes secrets, as a general rule, it is recommended
        to check all Kubernetes manifests (typically YAML files) and
        ensure that no secrets are embedded there. Likewise, the manifests
        should not use Kubernetes secret objects as environment variables
        to avoid e.g. leaking them when the whole environment is printed
        during debugging.

        Kubernetes supports secrets as first-class objects, but care
        needs to be taken to ensure that access to secrets is carefully
        limited. Using an external secrets provider can ease the management
        of access to secrets, especially where secrets are used across
        both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments.

        Encrypting the etcd database ensures that secrets along with the
        rest of the database is encrypted at rest.

        It might be prudent to consider the use of an external secrets
        storage and management system, instead of using Kubernetes
        Secrets directly, if you have more complex secret management
        needs. Ensure the solution requires authentication to access
        secrets, has auditing of access to and use of secrets, and encrypts
        secrets. Some solutions also make it easier to rotate secrets.
