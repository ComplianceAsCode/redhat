        OpenShift components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While OpenShift can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, OpenShift does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        To configure an IdP, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-ldap-identity-provider.html#configuring-ldap-identity-provider

        OpenShift end-user account management is inherited from

        To meet FISMA requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the respinsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        Using Role Based Access Control (RBAC), OpenShift roles can be used
        to grant various levels of access both cluster-wide as well as at
        the project scope. Users and gruops can be associated with, or bound
        to, multiple roles at the same time.

        For service accounts that might also have privileged access, Security
        Context Constraints (SCC) should be used to limit privileged actions
        in service accounts.

        For the cluster, the kubeadmin user should be completely disabled.

        logs to remote destinations. These remote destinations, such as

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).

#       ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-8:
#       Implimentation of this control varies between customers. Some agencies
#       maintain an inventory that state "OpenShift 4.x," whereas others want
#       named RPMs installed on the OpenShift components. The vast majority
#       follow the "OpenShift 4.x" listings. For those that do not, and want
#       complete listings of underlying RPMs, the following section should be
#       uncommented and updated.
#
#       If Satellite is managing the OpenShift nodes, documenting how OpenShift
#       components integrate into Satellite for centralized inventory management
#       is perfectly acceptable.

##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD

##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,

        'The customer will be responsible for handling and retaining
        information within, or hosted by, OpenShift in
        accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
        directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational
        requirements. A successful control response will need to outline
        the specific requirements applicable to customer information
        handling and retention, and the means by which those requirements
        are met.

        Documentation and suggestions on protecting customer information
        hosted within the OpenShift environment is forthcoming. This activity
        is being tracked in Jira:
