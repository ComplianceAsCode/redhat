        disseminating Configuration Management policy and procedures. A
        successful control response will need to address the content of the
        policy (which must include purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
        management commitment, coordination, and compliance) and procedures
        (which must facilitate the implementation of the policies and

        for initiating the review process, updaitng the policy and
        procedures, and providing approval of the updates

        The customer will be responsible for coordinating and providing
        oversight for the configuration control activities through a central
        means of communicating major changes or developments that may affect
        services to the federal government. The means of communication must
        be approved and accepted by the JAB. A successful control response
