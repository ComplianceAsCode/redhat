        Red Hat OpenShift enables auditing by default for the API Servers,

        be turned off which makes the control inherently met.

        The control asks for the following information to be audited:
          - what type of event occurred (verb is logged)
          - when the event occurred (timestamp is logged)
          - where the event occurred (request stage, the physical location of the file)
          - the source of the event (sourceIP, user are logged)
          - the outcome of the event (responseStatus is logged)
          - the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with
            the event (user UUID is logged which can be correlated with the real

        In case writing an audit record fails, all the API servers increase the

        Red Hat OpenShift audit servers allow to configure the maximum size
        of an audit log file, the maximum number of audit logs. Together with
        the separate partition the audit logs reside on, this can be used to
        alleviate concerns about running out of space.

        At the moment, the apiservers don't support performing a configurable
        action in case creating an audit log entry fails.
        However, the AlertManager can be configured to call a webhook in
        case writing the audit records fails. Because overwriting the old
        logs is an acceptable action for FedRAMP moderate, the webhook could
        just delete the old logs. A follow up ticket to create such webhook

        Per AU-4 (1), OpenShift will be configured to offload audit records
        to a centralized audit facility. Enforcement of dual authorization
        for movement and/or deletion of organization-defined audit
        information is the responsibility of the centralized audit
        facility, and outside the scope of OpenShift configuration.

        The Red Hat OpenShift audit logs are emited by the API servers
        and stored on the master nodes.
        The API servers do not support retaining audit logs for at least a
        defined number of days, therefore the logs must be offloaded from
        the cluster.

        The Cluster Logging Operator is able to forward the Red Hat OpenShift
        audit logs so that they can be stored per organizational policy.
