        The organization will be responsible for developing, documenting, and
        disseminating System Maintenance policy and procedures. A successful
        control response will need to address the content of the policy
        (which must include purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
        management commitments, coordination, and compliance) and procedures
        (which must facilitate the implementation of the policies and
        associated controls).

        review process, updating the policy and procedures, and providing
        approval of the updates.

        The customer will be responsible for approving and monitoring
        non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities. Because of the nature
        of a cloud system, all maintenance and diagnostic activities will be
        considered non-local. Therefore, this control can largely be
        addressed by reference to acess control authorizations (see AC-2)
        and the auditing and monitoring discussions in the AU family and SI-4. A
        successful control response will need to address the personnel or roles
        who are authorized to perform maintenance and diagnostic activities,
        and how those activities are tracked.
