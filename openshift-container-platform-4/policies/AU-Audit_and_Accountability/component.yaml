        To aide in such organizational processes, note that OpenShift's

        Note: When AU-4 (1) is enforced OpenShift will be configured
        to off-load audit records onto a different system
        or media than the system being audited. In practice this correlates
        to offloading audit records to a SIEM (e.g. Elastic). However,
        this control is specifically about centralized review and analysis,
        and not offloading records, thus AU-6 (4) is marked as not
