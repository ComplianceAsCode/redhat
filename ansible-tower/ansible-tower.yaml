        'There are three types of Tower users that can be assigned:

        - Normal User
        Normal Users have read and write access limited to the resources
        (such as inventory, projects, and job templates) for which that user
        has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges.

        - System Auditor
        Auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects
        within the Tower environment.

        - System Adminisrator
        A Tower System Administrator (also known as a Superuser) has admin,
        read, and write privileges over the entire Tower installation. A
        System Administrator is typically responsible for managing all
        aspects of Tower and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day
        work to various Users.

        Ansible Tower uses role-based access control to provide the ability
        to read, modify, and administer projects, inventories, job templates,
        and other Ansible Tower elements. The role-based access control policies
        can be defined per-user, or per user type as indicated above.

        Additional detail can be found in the Ansible Tower documentation:

        https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/users.html'

        'By default Ansible Tower generates audit records containing
        information that establishes what type of event occured,
        when the event occured, where the event occured, the source
        of the event, the outcome of the event, and the identity
        of individuals or subjects associated with the event.

        Ansible Tower cannot be configured to be out of compliance
        with this control.

        A sample audit record is provided below.

        TYPE OF EVENT:
        The "operation" field identifies the type of event recorded.
        In this case, a new user was created.

        WHEN THE EVENT OCCURED:
        The "timestamp" field indicates the system time of
        when the event occured. In this example the event happened
        at 2018-06-19T00:46:45.337458Z.

        WHERE THE EVENT OCCURED:
        The "X-API-Node" field indicates where the event occured. In
        this example, the host was tower.redhatgov.io.

        SOURCE OF EVENT:
        The "actor" field indicates the "alice" username initiated
        this event.

        OUTCOME OF EVENT:
        The "changes" field indicate the user was created with
        associated metadata such as first_name and last_name.

        IDENTITY OF INDIVIDUALS/OBJECTS INVOLVED:
        The "summary_fields" indicates an actor with the username "alice"
        created a new user with the username "bob."

        Full documentation of all available fields is
        available in the Ansible Tower product documentation:

## BEGINNING OF:
## CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
##

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
