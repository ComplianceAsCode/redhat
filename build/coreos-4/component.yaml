        CoreOS components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While CoreOS can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, CoreOS does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software, and therefore, this control is partial,
        and will only be partially satisfied when implemented by
        third party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        The ability to use Ignition scripts to configure CoreOS
        to add local users means that this control needs to be
        addressed for the case that a local user was added.

        See https://jira.coreos.com/browse/CMP-199 for local
        user account handling in CoreOS.

        To meet FISMA requirements, CoreOS must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the respinsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        This is an organizational/procedural control outside the scope of
        CoreOS configuration.

        The customer will be responsible for requiring users to use the
        lowest level of access required to perform any given function. In
        terms of CoreOS, this may require creation of multiple logon
        accounts per user. When users require access to privileged functions
        or capability, they will need to logout from the unprivileged account
        and login with an account that has received appropriate RBAC rights.

        Note CoreOS does not have privilege escalation capabilities similar
        to sudo in Linux. Users will have to completely logout/login when
        requiring privilege escalation between accounts.

        CoreOS utilizes the firewall technology embedded into the

        immediately. This gives an CoreOS operator the ability to immediately
        drop all remote connections.

        Additionally, CoreOS nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.

#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. Red Hat Identity
#       Management Admins) to handle configuration management the
#       lines below can be uncommented:

## Developers note on SA-10
##  A successful control response will document all network
##  information. Take care to document internal network usage,
