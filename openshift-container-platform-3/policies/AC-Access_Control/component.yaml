        'OpenShift utilizes the firewall technology embedded into Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux. This technology, named firewalld, allows a system
        administrator to configure host-based rules which take effect
        immediately. This gives an OpenShift operator the ability to immediately
        drop all remote connections. 

        Additionally, OpenShift nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.'
