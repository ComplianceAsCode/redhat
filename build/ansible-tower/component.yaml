        Ansible Tower's Role-based Access Control (RBAC) implementation
        offers multiple types of information system accounts, each
        with differing access and administrative roles.

        - "Normal User," an individual would have read and write
        access limited to the resources (such as inventory, projects, and
        job templates) for which that user has been granted appropriate
        roles and privileges.

        - "System Auditor," an individual would implicitly inherit
        the read-only capability for all objects within the Ansible Tower
        environment.

        - "System Administrator," also known as a Superuser, an
        individual has full system administration privileges for Tower -- with full
        read and write privileges over the entire Ansible Tower installation. A
        System Administrator is typically responsible for managing all aspects of
        Ansible Tower and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day work to various
        Users. Assign with caution!

        Role-based Access Controls (RBAC) are built into Ansible Tower and allow
        Ansible Tower administrators to delegate access to server inventories, organizations,
        and more. Administrators can also centralize the management of various credentials,
        allowing end users to leverage a needed secret without ever exposing that secret to the
        end user. RBAC controls allow Ansible Tower to help you increase security and streamline
        management.

        Documentation of Ansible Tower's RBAC system is available in the Ansible Tower User Guide:

        The Ansible Tower logging subsystems can assist with monitoring the use of Ansible Tower
        accounts. Logging is a standalone feature introduced in Ansible Tower that provides
        the capability to send detailed logs to several kinds of 3rd party external log
        aggregation services.

        For full details of the logging subsystem, including technical documentation and
        data schema details, refer to the "Tower Logging and Aggregation" chapter of the

        Ansible Tower offers supported integrations with many account management
        systems, such as Kerberos, Azure Active Directory, LDAP, RADIUS, SAML, TACACS+,
        and many others.

        Refer to the Ansible Tower Administration Guide for guidance on connecting
        Ansible Tower into an automated account management system:

        https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/ent_auth.html

        NOTE: To meet many account management requirements, such as those dealing with
        password complexity, an external account management system MUST be used!

        Ansible Tower does not natively have the capability to automatically
        remove or disable temporary and emergency accounts.

        When Ansible Tower is configured to authenticate users against an external
        authentication service (e.g. Red Hat IdM), the external provider would be
        responsible for removal and disablement of temporary and emergency accounts.
        In such scenarios, Ansible Tower would inherit satisfaction of this control
        from the external authentication service.

        A fringe case does exist in which an organizational user is temporarily
        given access to Ansible Tower (e.g. temporary team member joining for a
        sprint). In such cases, Ansible Tower does not have the ability to automatically
        remove or disable the account after an organizationally-defined time period. An
        Ansible Tower administrator would need to manually remove
        or disable the account.

        Ansible Tower does not natively have the capability to automatically
        disable inactive accounts after an organization-defined time period.

        When Ansible Tower is configured to authenticate users against an external
        authentication service (e.g. Red Hat IdM), the external provider would be
        responsible for automatic disablement of accounts. In such scenarios,
        Ansible Tower would inherit satisfaction of this control from the
        external authentication service.

        However, a fringe case does exist when:
        - Ansible Tower is configured to use an external authentication service, such as
        a corporate Red Hat IdM or Active Directory instance; and,
        - An organizational user is added to Ansible Tower however does not login
        for a time period that exceeds the organization-defined threshhold; and,
        - During that time period the user logins to other corporate services, thus
        the external authentication provider shows the account is being actively used.

        In such a scenario, Ansible Tower does not currently have the capability to
        automatically disable the account. An Ansible Tower administrator would need to manually
        remove or disable the account.

        Introduced in Ansible Tower 2.4 is a feature which adds an Auth-Token-Timeout
        to every response that includes a valid user-supplied token. This setting
        changed to Session-Timeout in Ansible Tower 3.3. The value of Session-Timeout
        is determined by the configuration (time expressed in seconds) of the
        SESSION_COOKIE_AGE.

        The value of Session-Timeout indicates the length of time, in seconds,
        that the supplied token is valid, from the moment the request was initiated.
        Starting in Ansible Tower 3.2, this setting can be changed as documented in
        the "Changing Default Timeout for Authentication" section of the
        Ansible Tower Administration documentation:

        A sample audit record is provided below.

        TYPE OF EVENT:
        The "operation" field identifies the type of event recorded.
        In this case, a new user was created.

        WHEN THE EVENT OCCURED:
        The "timestamp" field indicates the system time of

        at 2018-06-19T00:46:45.337458Z.

        WHERE THE EVENT OCCURED:
        The "X-API-Node" field indicates where the event occured. In
        this example, the host was tower.redhatgov.io.

        SOURCE OF EVENT:
        The "actor" field indicates the "alice" username initiated

        OUTCOME OF EVENT:
        The "changes" field indicate the user was created with
        associated metadata such as first_name and last_name.

        - Audit and Log Data Access (Success and Failure):
        https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/460

        - Export of Information (Success and Failure):
        https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/461 Information within
        Ansible Tower pertains to the Ansible Tower configuration. While
        Playbooks/Projects may be created within Tower locally and can be
        exported, the best practices recommend that the actual automation
        functions be maintained outside of Tower - in a version controlled
        repository and/or a CMDB for instance. The Ansible Tower specific
        data can be exported using 2 methods:

        - The first method is to use the "setup.sh" script to back up the
          system:
          https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/backup_restore.html
          This will successfully export all the Tower specific data including
          - the database
          - the SECRET_KEY file
          The per-system backups include:
          - custom user config files
          - job stdout
          - manual projects (if external version control systems are not being used to store playbooks)

          OS level controls methods (such as tripwire) could be used to check
          who ran the setup.sh script and when.

        - Information about Tower may be also gleaned via the APIs. For instance
          a list of users configured can be obtained from the following API endpoint: `GET /api/v2/users/`
          Example:
            ```
                    {
            "id": 15,
            "type": "user",
            "url": "/api/v2/users/15/",
            "related": {
                "admin_of_organizations": "/api/v2/users/15/admin_of_organizations/",
                "organizations": "/api/v2/users/15/organizations/",
                "roles": "/api/v2/users/15/roles/",
                "access_list": "/api/v2/users/15/access_list/",
                "teams": "/api/v2/users/15/teams/",
                "credentials": "/api/v2/users/15/credentials/",
                "activity_stream": "/api/v2/users/15/activity_stream/",
                "projects": "/api/v2/users/15/projects/"
            },
            "summary_fields": {
                "user_capabilities": {
                    "edit": true,
                    "delete": true
                }
            },
            "created": "2018-08-15T10:30:39.041Z",
            "username": "sysops2",
            "first_name": "Sysops2",
            "last_name": "Sysops2",
            "email": "sys@ops.com",
            "is_superuser": false,
            "is_system_auditor": false,
            "ldap_dn": "",
            "external_account": null,
            "auth": []
            },
            ```

           An export of all changes made to the system can be obtained at the
           API end-point: `/api/v2/activity_stream`. For example the following
           output indicates that a new project was created:
             ```
                "operation": "create",
            "changes": {
                "credential": null,
                "scm_branch": "",
                "name": "Meetup Demos",
                "scm_update_cache_timeout": 0,
                "scm_clean": false,
                "scm_url": "https://github.com/termlen0/meetups",
                "scm_delete_on_update": false,
                "local_path": "",
                "scm_type": "git",
                "timeout": 0,
                "scm_update_on_launch": false,
                "organization": "Default",
                "id": 29,
                "description": ""
            },
            ```

           The APIs themselves are available to all Tower users. However, the
           APIs are scoped to whatever that particular user is able to
           accomplish over the GUI. This is normal since all GUI components are
           built off of the API and there is a 1-1 relationship between the two.
           While the activity stream keeps track of the changes made, user
           clicks across the different APIs are not logged.

        - Import of Information (Success and Failure):

        Certain events, such as updating Projects, may pull data
        from a SCM. In such cases the audit event includes the content
        defined in AU-3 as well as the URL if the information being imported.

        A sample audit event for updating a "Demo Project" with content from
        GitHub is below. The "scm_url" field reflects source of information
        being imported and "status" field indicates succes or failure:

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. Red Hat Identity
#       Management Admins) to handle configuration management the
#       lines below can be uncommented:

        Ansible Tower installations can occur in a High Availabiltiy (HA) configuration.
        In this configuration, Tower runs with a single active node, called the Primary
        Instance, and any number of inactive nodes, called Secondary Instances.

        Secondary Instances can become Primary Instances at any time, with certain
        caveats. Running in a high-availability setup requires any database that
        Ansible Tower uses to be external -- Postgres and MongoDB must be installed
        on a machine that is not one of the primary or secondary Ansible Tower nodes.

        Ansible Tower's HA mode offers a standby Ansible Tower infrastructure that
        can become active in case of infrastructure failure -- avoiding single points of
        failure. HA mode is not meant to run in an active/passive or multi-master mode, and
        is not a mechanism for horizontally scaling the Ansible Tower service. Further,
        failover to a secondary instance is not automatic and must be user triggered.

        For instructions on how to install Ansible Tower into an HA configuration,
        refer to the Ansible Tower Installation and Reference Guide:

        Ansible Tower introduced Clustering as an alternate approach to redundancy,
        replacing the redundancy solution configured with the active-passive nodes
        that involves primary and secondary instances.

        Clustering is sharing load between hosts. Each instance should be able to act
        as an entry point for UI and API access. This should enable Ansible Tower
        administrators to use load balancers in front of as many instances of Ansible Tower
        as desired and maintain good data visibility.

        Details of this approach are documented in the "Clustering" section of the
        Ansible Tower Administration Guide:

        directly to the password prompt and decrypting the password before

## Developers note on SA-4 (1):
##  This control requires that developers of system components, e.g.
##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of
##  functional properties. Implimentation details are offered in
##  SA-4(2).

##
##  The majority of FedRAMP and FISMA Moderate systems refine this control

##    - Provide design and implementation regarding security-relevant
##      external system interfaces and high-level design;
##    - Provide design and implementation information required by the
##      SDL process;
##    - Above should be provided with a level of detail sufficient for
##      secure deployment.
