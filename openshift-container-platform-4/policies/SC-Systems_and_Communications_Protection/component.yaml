        OpenShift uses the concept of namespaces or projects to ensure
        workload isolation. The OpenShift platform comes with several
        default projects that start with the "openshift-" prefix. [1] Such
        projects, host functionality that's critical for the cluster's
        operations. Only Cluser Administrators have access to these namespaces,
        which ensures that regular users don't hace access to cluster
        management functionality.

        Besides the aforementioned project separation, user permissions are also
        managed via RBAC, which is enabled by default [2]. This prevents unprivileged
        users from using privileged functionality.

        The customer is responsible for deployment utilizing namespaces,
        host roles and other features as well as policies and procedures
        to implement and ensure continued isolation of security functions
        from non-security functions.

        A common way of ensuring that workloads land on certain nodes is
        through the usage of taints and tolerations [1]. This ensure that
        unless a workload tolerates the specified taints on the node, it won't
        be scheduled there.

        Another alternative is the usage of node affinity which allows a
        workload to specify a set of restrictions for it to be scheduled [2].

        These mechanisms can be used to ensure that only allowed hardware
        is used to run the desired workloads.

        OpenShift namespaces/projects are used to isolate resources
        in the cluster. If a Secret or a ConfigMap object exists
        in the cluster, it will only be accessible by other resources
        on that same namespace. Only users with explicit access to a
        namespace are able to access those objects.

        Accidental exposure of secrets is prevented by the Kubelet itself,
        since it's responsible of deleting the secret once no
        workload is using it [1]

        Depending on the exposure of the workloads or the component that's
        intended to be protected, OpenShift offers several settings to enforce
        rate-limiting and protection against denial of service attacks.

        It is recommended that all workloads in the system establish appropriate
        resource requests and limits to avoid resource starvation of critical
        workloads. Appropriate configurations exist to manage resource
        overcommitment [1]. Ensure that appropriate quotas are set in each
        relevant project [2], or establish a cluster quota to limit the resources
        that workloads can take [3].

        OpenShift also allows the configuration of egress and ingress traffic
        for individual workloads [4]. This ensures that workloads don't get
        overwhelmed by incoming traffic, and that they don't act as Denial
        of Service agents.

        If a workload is to be exposed externally, it is recommended that it's
        behind an OpenShift Route. Routes allow for the configuration of several
        security attributes, but most relevant to this control is the rate-limiting
        settings that it allows to configure in the form of annotations. configuring
        rate-limiting settings for a workload exposed on a route not only protects
        the workload itself, but also ensures that the target workload doesn't
        interfere with other workloads placed on the same node or set of nodes.

        On the other hand, OpenShift's API is configured with the Kubernetes API
        Priority & Fairness feature enabled by default. This feature allows for
        fine-grained configuration of the handling of incoming requests. [6]
        This way it's possible to control how the cluster will react on an
        overload situation. By default, OpenShift has a catch-all configuration
        that classifies every request.

        Finally, regardless of the environment that OpenShift is deployed in,
        it is assumed that there is a load balancer or load balancing service
        handling requests for the OpenShift API. This provides redundancy and
        extra protection when dealing with Denial of Service attacks.
