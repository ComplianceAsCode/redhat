        The Compliance Operator [1] scans the host and the platform (OCP)
        configuration for software flaws and improper configurations according
        to different compliance benchmarks. It uses OpenSCAP as a backend,
        which is a known and certified tool to do such scans.

        The default results are presented by the operator in the form of
        ComplianceCheckResults, which are Kubernetes objects. These objects
        are labeled with the appropriate severity of the finding.

        It is also possible to download the raw results which contain
        information such as the risk score.

        For the purpose of conducting a vulnerability scan of OpenShift, the OpenShift API and nodes
        should be scanned using the OpenShift Compliance Operator. OpenShift supports
        RBAC for users and groups, appropriate vulnerability scans can be performed against
        the OpenShift web application interface. For the OpenShift Compliance Operator, only OpenShift
        Cluster Administators are able to access and run the operator for compliance and vulnerability scans.
