        OpenShift components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While OpenShift can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, OpenShift does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        To configure an IdP, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html

        Note that the using the htpasswd IDP type cannot cover this
        control, therefore using httpasswd based IDPs should render
        the system non-compliant.

        OpenShift does not have the ability to automatically

        To meet FISMA requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the responsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        OpenShift automatically audits creation of the Identity
        API objects which subsequently allow to match the creation
        of the OpenShift identity to the external IDP identity. See
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/audit-log-view.html
        for documentation on how to view the audit logs and
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/audit-log-policy-config.html

        To meet the requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication via an IDP. The account
        inactivity timeout can be either configured per OAuth client
        as described here:
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/configuring-oauth-clients.html#oauth-token-inactivity-timeout_configuring-oauth-clients

        Or globally (this example uses 600s timeout):
        $ oc patch oauth.config cluster -p '{"spec":{"tokenConfig":{"accessTokenInactivityTimeout": "600s"}}}' --type='merge'

        Note that the global configuration does not change the configuration
        of the oauthclient objects, so for proper compliance check, both must
        be audited.

        Also note that prior to OpenShift 4.8, changing the global oauth.config
        object triggers a rollout of the kube-apiserver which can take up
        to 15 minutes. You can watch the kube-apiserver rollout with
        "oc get co kube-apiserver". Once the rollout finishes, the "Progressing"
        column will say "False".

        Establishing and administering privileged user accounts in accordance with a
        role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and
        privileges into roles is an organizational control outside the scope of OpenShift

        However to facilitate a control response, using Role Based Access Control (RBAC),
        OpenShift roles can be used to grant various levels of access both cluster-wide as well as at
        the project scope. Users and groups can be associated with, or bound
        to, multiple roles at the same time.

        For service accounts that might also have privileged access, Security
        Context Constraints (SCC) should be used to limit privileged actions
        in service accounts.

        For the cluster, the kubeadmin user should be completely disabled.

        More information on RBAC can be viewed at:

        OpenShift uses the concept of users and groups to segregate subjects and objects.
        A user can be assigned to one or more groups, each of which represent a certain
        set of users. Groups are useful when managing authorization policies to grant
        permissions to multiple users at once, for example allowing access to objects
        within a project, versus granting them to users individually.

        OpenShift Security Context Constraints (SCC) control the actions that a pod can
        perform and what it has the ability to access.

        Changes to OpenShift information flows take effect immediately. It is assumed
        that all information flow modifications have undergone organizational
        approval processes prior to being implemented in OpenShift.

        OpenShift cannot protect against authenticated users who were
        given authorization to execute administrative commands (such as
        information flow modifications).

        Privileged Administrators are defined as authenticated users who
        were given authorization to execute privileged commands on OpenShift
        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        To modify security policies users must first authenticate with
        standard credentials (e.g. username/password or username/key).
        Once authenticated users must elevate privileges to root access
        through usage of "sudo", which will require users to re-authenticate
        themselves.

        The default system behavior allows Privileged Administrators
        to (re)configure security policy filters. For example,
        to reflect changes in network security policies, Privileged
        Administrators can dynamically change the allowed network
        ports and protocols that security policy mechanisms (such
        as firewalld) check in accordance with the definitions

        Note: OpenShift does not have privilege escalation capabilities similar

        requiring privilege escalation between accounts.

        It is recommended to grant the cluster-admin clusterrole

        The customer will be responsible for defining events or conditions
        requiring disconnection (for example, user requesting logout),

        arise. Because a very common condition is to disconnect a user
        after a certain period of time, this control response describes
        how to configure the internal OAuth server’s token duration.

        To meet the requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication via an IDP. The token
        duration can be then be configured globally:
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/configuring-internal-oauth.html#oauth-configuring-internal-oauth_configuring-internal-oauth

        Or per client:
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/rest_api/oauth_apis/oauthclient-oauth-openshift-io-v1.html#oauthclient-oauth-openshift-io-v1

        Note that the global configuration does not change the configuration
        of the oauthclient objects, so for proper compliance check, both must
        be audited.

        Also note that prior to OpenShift 4.8, changing the global oauth.config
        object triggers a rollout of the kube-apiserver which can take up
        to 15 minutes. You can watch the kube-apiserver rollout with

        The customer will be responsible for requiring remote access

        customer-defined network access control points. A successful control
        response will need to address the nature, number, and location of
        such access control points, as well as the security controls in place
        to protect those access control points.

        Managed access points can be created and configured through the use of
        bastion hosts, ingress rule(s), and/or opening a route to a new access point.

        Documentation for creating and using a bastion host can be viewed at:

        This control is inherently met by Red Hat OpenShift.

        OpenShift nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.

        In order to disconnect all users, delete all OAuth tokens:
        $ oc delete oauthaccesstoken --all

        Since neither Kubernetes nor Red Hat OpenShift support CRLs or
        OSCP, the advice is not to use x509 certificates. If certificates
        must absolutely be used, use very short-lived certificates and
        as a last resort, instead of preventing authentication, remove all
        RBAC rules associated with accounts that possess x509 certificates.

        The control asks for the following information to be audited:
          - what type of event occurred (verb is logged)
          - when the event occurred (timestamp is logged)
          - where the event occurred (request stage, the physical location of the file)

          - the outcome of the event (responseStatus is logged)
          - the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with

        Red Hat OpenShift audit servers allow to configure the maximum size
        of an audit log file, the maximum number of audit logs. Together with
        the separate partition the audit logs reside on, this can be used to
        alleviate concerns about running out of space.

        At the moment, the apiservers don't support performing a configurable
        action in case creating an audit log entry fails.
        However, the AlertManager can be configured to call a webhook in

        The recommended approach for configuration management in the OpenShift Container
        platform is to implement the principles and patterns of GitOps

        GitOps uses Git pull requests to manage infrastructure and application configurations.
        The Git repository is considered the only source of truth and contains the
        entire state of the system so that the trail of changes to the system state are
        visible and auditable.

        Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes
        application. Watching over the OpenShift environment, using its current
        state to make decisions in real time. The Machine Config Operator (MCO)
        manages updates and configuration changes to essentially everything between
        the kernel and kubelet.

        For additional information:
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/cicd_gitops.html
        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/olm-what-operators-are.html

        Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) is the preferred way of implementing

        All of Red Hat OpenShift's control plane components are managed by operators.
        Operators themselves expose functionality and configuration through
        declarative objects that can be represented as YAML files, but ultimately
        get stored and persisted in etcd. Due to the declarative nature of
        how operators work, Red Hat OpenShift inherently meets this requirement as it's
        trivial and encouraged for administrators to store the YAML files that
        are used to configure the cluster in means that allow for further automation.
        This goes from the high level control plane components, down to the Operating
        System configurations. It's all managed through Kubernetes Objects.

        This allows for keeping the cluster's configuration in git and establishing
        a GitOps sort of workflow for configuring the cluster and ensuring that
        configuration changes are tracked, audited, and stored securely.

        Furthermore, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Manager allows for managing
        multiple clusters and their configurations centrally and securely [1].

        Customers must then choose what path do they want to take to store their baseline
        configurations and enforce their usage.

#       ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-8:
#       Implementation of this control varies between customers. Some agencies
#       maintain an inventory that state "OpenShift 4.x," whereas others want
#       named RPMs installed on the OpenShift components. The vast majority
#       follow the "OpenShift 4.x" listings. For those that do not, and want
#       complete listings of underlying RPMs, the following section should be
#       uncommented and updated.
#
#       If Satellite is managing the OpenShift nodes, documenting how OpenShift
#       components integrate into Satellite for centralized inventory management
#       is perfectly acceptable.

        It is up to the customer to review and implement an appropriate
        system component inventory. However, Red Hat provides tools that can
        aid customers in generating such inventories and keeping them up-to-date.

        A summary of the cluster's specification is available through the
        ClusterVersion object [1]. This will provide information both on the version
        and the specific container hash used. A list of the control plane operators
        used for managing Red Hat OpenShift is available through the ClusterOperator
        object [2].

        Knowing this information, it's possible to get the list of packages for the
        underlying hosts, as well as their versions. This can be done by
        inspecting OpenShift's payload [3].

        Installed operators with their respective versions can be listed through the
        ClusterServiceVersion [4] object. Note that this is a namespaced resource, so
        all namespaces need to be inspected.

        Finally, Red Hat also provides the Skopeo [5] and Podman [6] to further inspect
        any container images used in the deployment. These tools can help fill out extra
        details about the contents of the containers used in the system.

        However to assist Systems Administrators and Security personnel in

        For disconnected clusters, there is no way to send telemetry data to

        To assist Systems Administrators and Security personnel in answering
        this control in relation to OpenShift, Red Hat does not provide
        disaster recovery subscriptions for OpenShift. However, there are a
        couple of ways that a cluster can be configured to failover in the case
        of emergency or catastrophic failure. One way is to configure the
        cluster with geographically diverse set of nodes in different
        availability zones. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.html for creating
        MachineSets for nodes to operate in different clouds.

        Alternatively, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes
        is a solution for multi-cluster deployment and management across
        different many differing operating environments. Red Hat Advanced
        Cluster Management for Kubernetes is considered a better tool to
        manage Kubernetes Clusters and to handle cluster failover in case of
        failure. Documentation can be viewed at:

        Ensuring  that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded
        in applications or access scripts or stored on function keys, is
        an organizational procedural requirement outside the scope of
        OpenShift configuration.

        Some general guidance can be provided for Kubernetes Secrets and
        private PKI keys stored on the filesystem.

        The private PKI keys are only protected by a combination of UNIX
        permissions and SELinux labels, but otherwise they are stored
        unencrypted on the filesystem.

        Regarding Kubernetes secrets, as a general rule, it is recommended
        to check all Kubernetes manifests (typically YAML files) and
        ensure that no secrets are embedded there. Likewise, the manifests
        should not use Kubernetes secret objects as environment variables
        to avoid e.g. leaking them when the whole environment is printed
        during debugging.

        Kubernetes supports secrets as first-class objects, but care
        needs to be taken to ensure that access to secrets is carefully
        limited. Using an external secrets provider can ease the management
        of access to secrets, especially where secrets are used across
        both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments.

        Encrypting the etcd database ensures that secrets along with the
        rest of the database is encrypted at rest.

        It might be prudent to consider the use of an external secrets
        storage and management system, instead of using Kubernetes
        Secrets directly, if you have more complex secret management
        needs. Ensure the solution requires authentication to access
        secrets, has auditing of access to and use of secrets, and encrypts
        secrets. Some solutions also make it easier to rotate secrets.

        Red Hat OpenShift does not have special maintenance or diagnostics
        accounts or login procedures except for backup and restore

        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.html
        For ssh access, the only permitted authenticator are ssh keys provided
        via MachineConfig objects.

        Similarly to what is being suggested in the AC control family,
        it is recommended to grant the cluster-admin clusterrole
        to a user or a group backed by an IDP and subsequently
        remove the kubeadmin user as described in https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/remove-kubeadmin.html

        With that, any login session can be terminated by removing the

        When restoring the etcd database, the RHCOS hosts need to be configured
        to terminate idle sessions.

        The customer is responsible for deployment utilizing namespaces,
        host roles and other features as well as policies and procedures
        to implement and ensure continued isolation of security functions
        from non-security functions.

        A common way of ensuring that workloads land on certain nodes is
        through the usage of taints and tolerations [1]. This ensure that
        unless a workload tolerates the specified taints on the node, it won't
        be scheduled there.

        Another alternative is the usage of node affinity which allows a
        workload to specify a set of restrictions for it to be scheduled [2].

        These mechanisms can be used to ensure that only allowed hardware
        is used to run the desired workloads.

        OpenShift namespaces/projects are used to isolate resources
        in the cluster. If a Secret or a ConfigMap object exists
        in the cluster, it will only be accessible by other resources
        on that same namespace. Only users with explicit access to a
        namespace are able to access those objects.

        Accidental exposure of secrets is prevented by the Kubelet itself,
        since it's responsible of deleting the secret once no
        workload is using it [1]

        Depending on the exposure of the workloads or the component that's
        intended to be protected, OpenShift offers several settings to enforce
        rate-limiting and protection against denial of service attacks.

        It is recommended that all workloads in the system establish appropriate
        resource requests and limits to avoid resource starvation of critical
        workloads. Appropriate configurations exist to manage resource
        overcommitment [1]. Ensure that appropriate quotas are set in each
        relevant project [2], or establish a cluster quota to limit the resources
        that workloads can take [3].

        OpenShift also allows the configuration of egress and ingress traffic
        for individual workloads [4]. This ensures that workloads don't get
        overwhelmed by incoming traffic, and that they don't act as Denial
        of Service agents.

        If a workload is to be exposed externally, it is recommended that it's
        behind an OpenShift Route. Routes allow for the configuration of several
        security attributes, but most relevant to this control is the rate-limiting
        settings that it allows to configure in the form of annotations. configuring
        rate-limiting settings for a workload exposed on a route not only protects
        the workload itself, but also ensures that the target workload doesn't
        interfere with other workloads placed on the same node or set of nodes.

        On the other hand, OpenShift's API is configured with the Kubernetes API
        Priority & Fairness feature enabled by default. This feature allows for
        fine-grained configuration of the handling of incoming requests. [6]
        This way it's possible to control how the cluster will react on an
        overload situation. By default, OpenShift has a catch-all configuration
        that classifies every request.

        Finally, regardless of the environment that OpenShift is deployed in,
        it is assumed that there is a load balancer or load balancing service
        handling requests for the OpenShift API. This provides redundancy and
        extra protection when dealing with Denial of Service attacks.

        While OpenShift auto-generates several PKIs to serve TLS on different
        endpoints of the system, it is possible and necessary to configure a
        custom PKI which allows external clients trust the endpoints.

        The Ingress Operator is the component responsible for enabling external
        access to OpenShift Container Platform cluster services. The aforementioned
        operator creates an internal CA and issues a wildcard certificate that is
        valid for applications under the .apps sub-domain. Both the web console
        and CLI use this certificate as well. The certificate and key would need
        to be replaced since a certificate coming from an approved provider is
        needed. [1]

        While the API Server certificates can't be replaced, it's possible to
        add extra certificates that it will serve in case there's the need
        for clients to have explicit trust for them. [2]

        OpenShift's internal DNS implementation inherently meets this
        control as the CoreDNS instances deployed by the cluster-dns-operator
        are run as a DaemonSet, and hence, run on every node on the cluster. [1]

        This implementation provides adequate fault tolerance since there
        are as many replicas as there are nodes in the cluster. Moreover,
        by default nodes in the cluster are deployed in different availability
        zones on the hosting cloud. This same pattern is recommended for
        on-prem deployments.

        OpenShift uses various TLS algorithms and ciphers to protect

        all of the control plane components in OpenShift use mutual-TLS
        to protect communications against the attacks mentioned by this
        control. [1] Thus, OpenShift inherently meets this requirement.

        Any Route exposed by the deployment also use TLS and have a policy
        to redirect requests to use TLS, and thus are secure by default.

        Logging in "initiates a session" by having the user
        authenticate and receive a token if the authentication
        succeeds [1].  When logging out, both via the CLI and
        the UI, the user's "session" is ended by having the
        token deleted and effectively revoked.

        The customer will be responsible for aggregating and correlating
        information from monitoring tools, for multiple system components.
        This is frequently accomplished with centralized audit reduction
        tools.

        OpenShift enables auditing by default for the API Servers, the OAuth
        server and the Linux hosts themselves. Auditing cannot be turned off.

        The Cluster Logging Operator is able to forward the aforementioned
        audit logs to a SIEM for further inspection and correlation of
        information. [1]

        In OpenShift, the logs depend greatly on the component. Some
        components would just write messages to stdout that the cluster
        administrator can retrieve logs through the use of the `oc` command.
        Some components emit events, and others emit a Prometheus metric which
        the API server would write into their logs.

        For the OCP components that run in a container (most operators),
        the usual RBAC rules would prevent a non-admin user from reading
        the container logs or events.

        OpenShift inherently meets this control as error message handling
        is designed to obscure or not log sensitive information such as
        passwords, credit card numbers, social security information,
        account information, etc.
