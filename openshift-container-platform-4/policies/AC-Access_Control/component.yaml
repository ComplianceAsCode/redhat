        OpenShift components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While OpenShift can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, OpenShift does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software, and therefore, this control is partial,
        and will only be partially satisfied when implemented by
        third party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

# AC-2(2) NOTES:
#       The customer will be responsible for automatically removing or
#       disabling emergency and temporary accounts within the required
#       timeframe. A successful control response will need to address
#       all of the procedures and mechanisms involved in disabling these
#       accounts.

        identity service (e.g. Active Directory, LDAP, etc.)
        This control will only be partially satisfied when
        OpenShift is configured to connect to an Identity Provider (IdP).

        OpenShift end-user account management is inherited from

        management level; for example, within LDAP, Red Hat

        To meet FISMA requirements, OpenShift must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the respinsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        Using Role Based Access Control (RBAC), OpenShift roles can be used
        to grant various levels of access both cluster-wide as well as at
        the project scope. Users and gruops can be associated with, or bound
        to, multiple roles at the same time.

        For service accounts that might also have privileged access, Security
        Context Constraints (SCC) should be used to limit privileged actions
        in service accounts.

        'Beginning with OpenShift 4.3, when OpenShift is deployed on Red Hat Enterprise
        Linux, and FIPS is enabled as a kernel setting, OpenShift will use OpenSSL
        libraries instead of the native Golang crypto. The system operator will need to
        verify that OpenShift is being deployed on a version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
        that has been FIPS validated.

        Prior to OpenShift 4.3, remote sessions were encrypted using Golang-provided
        cryptography. While not FIPS validated, this included the following
        cryptographic algorithms and ciphers to protect the confidentiality
        and integrity of remote access sessions:

        drop all remote connections.

        Additionally, OpenShift nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.'
