        The organization will be responsible for developing, documenting, and
        disseminating Security Assessment and Authorization policy and
        procedures. A successful control response will need to address the
        content of the policy (which must include purpose, scope, roles,
        responsibilities, management commitment, coordination, and compliance)
        and procedures (which must facilitate the implementation of
        the policies and associated controls).

        The organization will be responsible for reviewing and updating the
        Security Assessment and Authorization policy every 3 years, and
        procedures annually. A successful control response will need to
        address the review and update process, including the role(s)
        responsible for initiating the review process, updating the policy
        and procedures, and providing approval of the updates.

        The organization will be responsible for developing a Security Assessment
        Plan. A successful control response will need to address the
        involement of a FedRAMP-accredited 3PAO (see CA-2(1)), the scope
        of the assessment, and any specific requirements the organization has
        for the 3PAO.

        The customer will be responsible for employing a FedRAMP-accredited
        3PAO to conduct security control assessments. In addition to performing
        the assessment, this 3PAO will assist in the development of the Security
        Assessment Plan and Security Assessment Report (see CA-2).

        The customer will be responsible for ensuring that, at a minimum,
        vulnerability scanning is performed annually as part of the
        assessment process. A successful control response will need to address
        the minimum requirement, as well as discussing any additional testing
        performed during assessments, such as malicious user testing, insider
        threat assessment, performance/load testing, or other tests the customer
        chooses to perform.

        The customer will be responsible for authorizing connections to
        external information systems. A successful control response will
        need to address the individuals or roles responsible for engaging with
        authorized points of contact for such external systems and the process
        for documenting and signing the conditions of the connections in
        Interconnection System Agreements.

        The customer will be responsible for documenting the details of each
        interconnection. A successful control response will need to address
        the process for verifying the interface characteristics, security
        requirements, and the nature of the information communicated; a summary
        of this information will need to be included as part of the table
        above.

    - key: c

        The customer will be responsible for reviewing and updating the
        Interconnection Security Agreements at the required frequency. A

        The organization will be responsible for requiring unclassified,
        non-national security systems to connect to customer applications

        The customer will be responsible for determining whether connections
        to external information systems will be governed by an
        allow-all/deny-by-exception policy or by a deny-all/allow-by-exception
        policy. A successful control response will need to address the rationale
        for the selection. In addition, the policy choice and its rationale will
        need to be included in the Architecture Briefing and in the introductory
        sections of this Security Plan.

        The organization will be responsible for updating the accreditation
        package at the required frequency. A successful control response will
        need to address the components of the package that will be updated,
        the process for re-assessing the system in alignment with the updated
        package, and the personnel or roles responsible for managing the
        update process and engaging with FedRAMP for renewal of authorization.

        The organization will be responsible for developing a continuous
        monitoring strategy that meets the requirements. For metrics to be
        monitored, a successful control response will need to include a
        discussion of what information the organization considers important to
        monitor, as well as a rationale for that information being sufficient
        to demonstrate the ongoing security of the system.

        The organization will be responsible for developing a continuous
        monitoring strategy that meets the requirements. For frequency of
        monitoring, a successful control response will need to address the
        rationale for the selected frequency. This frequency should be
        compatible with the frequency of POA&M reporting specified in CA-5.

    - key: c
      text: |-
        The customer will be responsible for including ongoing security
        control assessments as part of the continuous monitoring program. This
        may include assessment of controls specifically found to be other than
        satisfied as part of the 3PAO assessments discussed in CA-2, as well as
        internal assessment of satisfied controls to verify continued
        effectiveness of implementation. A successful control response will
        need to address the roles or individuals responsible for testing, as
        well as the methodology used for testing.

    - key: d
      text: |-
        The customer will be responsible for monitoring the metrics defined
        in part (a) as part of continuous monitoring. A successful control
        response will need to discuss how metrics are gathered and reported,
        as well as the conditions under which monitoring will lead to changes
        or additions to related reporting, such as POA&M reporting.

    - key: e
      text: |-
        The customer will be responsible for correlating and analyzing
        security-related information gathered from multiple sources, including
        periodic assessments and continuous monitoring. A successful control
        response will need to address tools or processes used to perform
        correlation and analysis.

    - key: f

        The customer will be responsible for responding appropriately
        to the results of the analysis in part (e). A successful control
        response will need to discuss under what conditions each response action
        should be taken (for example, if a new vulnerability is found in the
        system, a POA&M item should be opened).

    - key: g
      text: |-
        The customer will be responsible for reporting the security status of
        the system in accordance with FedRAMP requirements at a regular
        frequency. This frequency should be compatible with the frequency of
        POA&M reporting specified in CA-5.

        The customer will be responsible for monitoring security controls on
        an ongoing basis with the assistance of an assessment team with a
        control-defined level of independance. Note that this may be the 3PAO
        used for recurring assessments, it may be a different independent
        assessor, or it may be a team of personnel employed by the customer. A
        successful control response will need to address the nature of this team
        and the methods by which they access security controls within the
        system.

        The customer will be responsible for conducting penetration testing
        at the required frequency. A successful control response will need to
        address the systems or components tested and outline the rules of
        engagement for testing (e.g. operational personnel are/are not notified
        in advance of testing, certain components of the system are off-limits
        for this test, etc.).

        customer environment. A successful control response will need to address
        the individual or roles with the authorizing responsibility, as well
        as how a determination is made to allow a connection between
        components or classes of components.

        The customer will be responsible for documenting the required
        information for each internal connection. This may be documented in

        response will need to address the process by which this documentation
        is created.
