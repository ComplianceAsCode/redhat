        CoreOS components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While CoreOS can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, CoreOS does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software, and therefore, this control is partial,
        and will only be partially satisfied when implemented by
        third party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        The ability to use Ignition scripts to configure CoreOS
        to add local users means that this control needs to be
        addressed for the case that a local user was added.

        See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CMP-199 for local
        user account handling in CoreOS.

# AC-2(2) NOTES:

#       disabling emergency and temporary accounts within the required
#       timeframe. A successful control response will need to address
#       all of the procedures and mechanisms involved in disabling these
#       accounts.

        CoreOS end-user account management is inherited from

        To meet FISMA requirements, CoreOS must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the respinsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        CoreOS utilizes the firewall technology embedded into the

        administrator to configure host-based rules which take effect
        immediately. This gives an CoreOS operator the ability to immediately
        drop all remote connections.

        Additionally, CoreOS nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.

        CoreOS was designed to satisfy the audit requirements outlined
        in the Configuration Annex to the Protection Profile for General
        Purpose Operating Systems available at
        https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/PP.cfm.

        Specifically, the minimum auditable events included:

        | Configuration Action | CNSSI 1253 Value or DoD-specific Value | NIAP Reference |
        | Audit All Logons (Success/Failure) and Logoffs (Successful) | Authentication events: (1) Logons (Success/Failure); (2) Logoffs (Success) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit File and Object Events (Unsuccessful) | File and Objects events: (1) Create (Success/Failure); (2) Access (Success/Failure); (3) Delete (Success/Failure); (4) Modify (Success/Failure); (5) Permission Modification (Success/Failure); (6) Ownership Modification (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit User and Group Management Events (Success/Failure) | User and Group Management events: (1) User add, delete, modify, disable, enable (Success/Failure); (2) Group/Role add, delete, modify (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit Privilege or Role Escalation Events (Success/Failure) | Privilege/Role escalation (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit All Audit and Log Data Accesses (Success/Failure) | Audit and log data access (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit Cryptographic Verification of Software (Success/Failure) | - | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit Program Initiations (Success/Failure) | Application (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, MS Office Suite, etc.) initialization (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit System Reboot, Restart, and Shutdown Events (Success/Failure) | System reboot, restart and shutdown (Success/Failure) | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |
        | Audit Kernel Module Loading and Unloading Events (Success/Failure) | - | FAU_GEN.1.1.c |

        Additionally, CoreOS was designed to satisfy the audit requirements
        outlined in Intelligence Community Standard Number 500-27, "Collection
        and Sharing of Audit Data" (ICS 500-27) that were found to be applicable
        to operating systems performing as a container host. A copy of ICS 500-27
        can be found at
        https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/FOIA/DF-2016-00213.pdf

        Selected audit events from ICS 500-27 include:
          * Authentication events
            * Logons (Success/Failure)
            * Logoffs (Success)

            * Permission Modifications (Success/Failure)
            * Ownership Modifications (Success/Failure)
          * User & Group Management events
            * User add, delete, modify, suspend, lock (Success/Failure)
            * Group/Role add, delete, modify (Success/Failure)
          * Use of Privileged/Special Rights events
            * Security or audit policy changes (Success/Failure)

        Determination of which events are to be audited within CoreOS from
        the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2(a) is an organizational
        control outside the scope of CoreOS configuration guidance.

        Should system operators decide to use the NIST National Checklist for
        OpenShift 4.x, all events identified in AU-2(c) are selected to be
        audited.

        Additionally, in regards to the AU-2(d) requirement of defining
        "the frequency" of auditing for each identified event, it should be
        noted that the CoreOS audit subsystem generates audit events in
        realtime (e.g. immediately upon an audited event occuring).

## BEGINNING OF:

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).

        connections to the customer application, for example via the

        The customer is responsible for implementing cryptographic
        mechanisms to prevent unauthorzed disclosure and modification of
        customer data. A successful control response will outline how
        cryptography is used to ensure integrity of data in rest and
        transport.

        When running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, full disk encryption
        is possible for data at rest on the CoreOS nodes. For data
        in transport, CoreOS uses cryptographic algorithms and ciphers to
        protect confidentiality and integrity of data in transport.
