        (which must include purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,

        The customer will be responsible for conducting a risk assessment,

        response will need to address the assessment methodology and calculation
        of the likelihood and magnitude of harm that could result from
        unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, or modification of
        IaaS layers, the customer application, and the information processed,
        stored, and transmitted by those systems.

        The customer will be responsible for documenting the results of the
        risk assessment in a Security Assessment Report. A successful control
