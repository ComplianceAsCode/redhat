        By default, the OpenShift API uses the internal system clocks to generate
        time stamps for audit records. At the code level, the OpenShift API
        stores audit events in a struct called MicroTime:

        // MicroTime is version of Time with microsecond level precision.
        //
        // +protobuf.options.marshal=false
        // +protobuf.as=Timestamp
        // +protobuf.options.(gogoproto.goproto_stringer)=false
        type MicroTime struct
        { time.Time `protobuf:"-"` }

        which really is a time.Time value which comes from the standard golang library:
