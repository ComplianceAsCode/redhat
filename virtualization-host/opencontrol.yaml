  description: |-
    Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) is a minimal operating system based
    on Red Hat Enterprise Linux that is designed to provide a simple method for
    setting up a physical machine to act as a hypervisor in a Red Hat
    Virtualization environment. The minimal operating system contains only the
    packages required for the machine to act as a hypervisor, and features
    a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host and performing
    administrative tasks.
