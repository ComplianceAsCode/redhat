        The customer is responsible for implementing cryptographic

        cryptography is used to ensure integrity of data in rest and
        transport.

        When running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, full disk encryption
        is possible for data at rest on the CoreOS nodes. For data
        in transport, CoreOS uses cryptographic algorithms and ciphers to
        protect confidentiality and integrity of data in transport.
